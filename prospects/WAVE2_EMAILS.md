## EMAIL 1: Snohomish County — Viggo Forde (CIO)
**To:** viggo.forde@snohomishcountywa.gov
**Subject:** Fellow Seattle tech person — quick intro

Hi Viggo,

Saw you've been leading IT for Snohomish County since your Microsoft days — and congrats on the Top 10 Government CIO recognition.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations with network infrastructure, security, and connectivity. I've supported other public sector and healthcare organizations in the region — including King County neighbors.

Not here to pitch anything. Just wanted to introduce myself as a local resource. When vendor questions come up, or you need a second opinion on infrastructure decisions, I'm happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket. If timing's ever right for a quick intro call, I'm around.

— Chris

**Subject:** Quick intro — CCIE Security in your backyard

Hi Greg,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations with network infrastructure, security, and connectivity.

Credit unions have unique challenges — member trust, compliance, and making tech investments stretch. If you ever need a sounding board on vendors, architecture decisions, or security questions, happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket.

— Chris

Hi Joseph,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations with network infrastructure and security architecture.

— Chris
