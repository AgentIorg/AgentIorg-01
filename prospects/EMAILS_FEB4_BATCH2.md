## 📧 EMAIL #1 - EXPEDITORS (CTO)

**TO:** larry.persaud@expeditors.com  
**SUBJECT:** Network infrastructure for Expeditors' global logistics

Hi Larry,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. I work with logistics and supply chain companies on their network infrastructure and security.

With Expeditors operating across 100+ countries, I imagine global connectivity and security are constant priorities — especially protecting shipment data and maintaining uptime across your distributed network.

We help companies like yours with:
- Global WAN optimization and SD-WAN
- Supply chain data security
- Multi-site connectivity and redundancy
- Network modernization (Cisco, Juniper, Palo Alto)

I'm not pitching today — just wanted to introduce myself as a local resource. We're Seattle-based and work with several logistics companies navigating similar infrastructure challenges.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!
