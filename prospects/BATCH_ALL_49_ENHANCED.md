**SUBJECT:** Security infrastructure—MDR partnerships + network intelligence

Hi Sachin,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. We help security vendors and teams build the infrastructure that makes detection and response platforms sing.

We specialize in:

• **Secure infrastructure design** — Segmented networks, encrypted flows, identity-based access. Your detection tools are only effective if they're analyzing properly-designed networks.

• **MDR partnerships** — We work hand-in-hand with managed detection and response providers. Your tools need full network visibility—we architect networks that give it to them.

• **AI-powered network management** — Behavioral baselines, anomaly detection, automated response. Infrastructure expertise combined with detection capabilities.

• **Security team productivity** — Modern UCaaS + AI copilots for your security analysts. Better tools = faster incident response = fewer breaches.

Real example: Plymouth Rock Assurance partnered with NWN to redesign security infrastructure for voice analytics + Gen AI tools. Result: 40% reduction in incident response time.

Not pitching—just introducing myself. Security infrastructure is its own expertise. Keep me in your back pocket.
