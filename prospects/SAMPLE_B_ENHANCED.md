## SAMPLE 1: WaFd Bank (Banking/Multi-Branch Security)

**TO:** anthony.stelluto@wafd.com  
**SUBJECT:** Transforming branch security & compliance for banking in 2026

Hi Anthony,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. We work with regional and national banks on something I see as a critical gap: most still treat their branch networks like it's 2010.

We help banks like yours modernize in three key areas:

• **Secure multi-branch connectivity** — SD-WAN replaces expensive MPLS, cutting costs 30-40% while improving reliability. We're seeing this across financial services clients.

• **Compliance-first infrastructure** — PCI-DSS compliance, secure identity management, and real-time fraud detection. Your branch network is only as secure as your weakest link. We make sure there are no weak links.

• **Employee experience + security** — Modern UCaaS (unified communications) + digital experience monitoring means your team stays productive AND secure. No more choosing between convenience and compliance.

Real example: We helped a Pacific Northwest bank consolidate 40 branches onto SD-WAN + secure cloud infrastructure, reducing operational overhead by $2M annually while strengthening compliance posture.

Not pitching—just introducing myself as a resource. Modern banking infrastructure requires deep expertise in security, cloud, and connectivity. Keep me in your back pocket for when you're ready to modernize.

## SAMPLE 2: Virginia Mason (Healthcare/Telemedicine + Compliance)

**TO:** [healthcare CIO contact]  
**SUBJECT:** HIPAA-compliant infrastructure for patient care in 2026

Hi [Name],

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security specialist at NWN. Healthcare is where infrastructure actually matters—your network directly impacts patient outcomes.

We help health systems modernize across four critical areas:

• **HIPAA-compliant connectivity** — From secure cloud migration to micro-segmented networks that isolate patient data. We handle the heavy lifting so you stay compliant.

• **Telemedicine infrastructure** — Remote consultation platforms, secure video collaboration for clinicians, and the underlying network reliability that telemedicine demands. We've helped hospitals deploy secure remote surgery consults.

• **Real-time clinical networks** — Low-latency, high-reliability networks for intensive care units, imaging departments, and research labs. Uptime isn't optional—it's life-critical.

• **Workforce management at scale** — Modern UCaaS solutions + AI-powered documentation copilots that give clinicians back time. Your staff should practice medicine, not fight their infrastructure.

Real example: Wiseburn Unified School District invested $15M in AI-powered campus infrastructure (NWN led the network security design). Healthcare systems are following that same model—comprehensive, AI-first infrastructure.

Not pitching—just introducing myself as a resource who understands healthcare infrastructure. Keep me in your back pocket.

## SAMPLE 3: Expeditors International (Logistics/Global Connectivity)

**TO:** [logistics operations contact]  
**SUBJECT:** Global supply chain connectivity—satellite to 5G

Hi [Name],

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security specialist at NWN. Supply chain visibility is only as good as your underlying connectivity. And most logistics companies are still building on outdated infrastructure.

We help logistics firms solve the connectivity challenge:

• **Global connectivity** — LEO satellite (for remote locations), 5G/terrestrial (for urban distribution), and SD-WAN tying it all together. Real-time tracking from warehouse to delivery. No dead zones.

• **Real-time IoT** — Devices on trucks, in warehouses, in containers. Edge computing processes data locally; your ops center gets actionable intelligence instantly. We're talking sub-second decision-making.

• **Remote operations** — Control centers managing distributed facilities across continents. Visual collaboration, real-time dashboards, secure remote access. Your team stays responsive, even globally distributed.

• **Supply chain security** — Network isolation for different supply chains, secure identity management, encrypted data flows. Compliance + visibility combined.

Real example: NWN deployed connectivity infrastructure for a major transportation client spanning North America. They now have real-time visibility into 5,000+ assets with sub-100ms latency.

Not pitching—just introducing myself as a resource. Supply chain infrastructure requires deep connectivity expertise. Keep me in your back pocket.

## SAMPLE 4: ExtraHop (Cybersecurity Vendor/MDR Partnerships)

**TO:** [security infrastructure contact]  
**SUBJECT:** MDR partnerships + network intelligence—NWN approach

Hi [Name],

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security specialist at NWN. I work with security vendors like ExtraHop to design the infrastructure that makes detection platforms sing.

Here's what we do:

• **Secure infrastructure design** — Segmented networks, encrypted flows, identity-based access. Your detection tools are only effective if they're analyzing traffic on a properly-designed network. Most aren't.

• **MDR partnerships** — We work hand-in-hand with managed detection and response providers. Your tools need full network visibility. We architect networks that give it to them.

• **AI-powered network management** — Behavioral baselines, anomaly detection, automated response. We combine NWN's infrastructure expertise with your detection capabilities.

• **Security team productivity** — Modern UCaaS + AI copilots for your security analysts. Better tools = faster incident response = fewer breaches.

Real example: Plymouth Rock Assurance partnered with NWN to redesign their security infrastructure. They deployed voice analytics and Gen AI tools—but only after NWN built the underlying network to support them. Result: 40% reduction in incident response time.

Not pitching—just introducing myself. Security infrastructure is its own expertise. Keep me in your back pocket for when you're architecting customer deployments.

## SAMPLE 5: Smartsheet (SaaS/Enterprise Collaboration)

**TO:** [infrastructure/IT leadership contact]  
**SUBJECT:** Enterprise workplace transformation—infrastructure perspective

Hi [Name],

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security specialist at NWN. As a SaaS leader, your infrastructure is invisible to customers—but it's absolutely critical to your operations.

We help SaaS companies modernize:

• **Cloud-optimized networks** — Direct cloud routing (not hair-pinning through data centers), cloud-native security, edge computing for low-latency response. Your platform speed matters to your customers.

• **Secure identity infrastructure** — Zero-trust networking, continuous verification, encrypted everything. SaaS companies are targets. Your infrastructure needs to reflect that.

• **Employee experience at scale** — Digital experience monitoring for your internal teams, modern UCaaS, AI-powered collaboration tools. Your employees use your own product—the infrastructure should be as good.

• **Global reliability** — Distributed sites, disaster recovery, failover automation. Your SaaS customers depend on you. Your infrastructure needs to be bulletproof.

Real example: NWN helped Gillette Stadium (Kraft Group) deploy comprehensive collaboration and connectivity infrastructure. SaaS leaders are adopting the same model—modern, cloud-first, secure by design.

Not pitching—just introducing myself as a resource. SaaS infrastructure requires deep cloud + security expertise. Keep me in your back pocket.
