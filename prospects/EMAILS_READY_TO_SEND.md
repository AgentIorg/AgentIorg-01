## 🔥 CRITICAL - SEND TODAY

### EMAIL #1: WaFd Bank

**TO:** [NEED CONTACT RESEARCH - Try: CIO or CISO]  
**SUBJECT:** Network infrastructure for WaFd's growing footprint

Hi [First Name],

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder and Account Executive at NWN. I work with regional banks and credit unions across the Pacific Northwest on their network infrastructure and security.

With WaFd's 200+ branches spanning 8 states, I imagine branch connectivity and security are top of mind — especially with the uptick in targeted attacks on regional financial institutions we've seen this year.

We help institutions like yours with:
- Secure multi-site connectivity (Cisco SD-WAN, DMVPN)
- PCI compliance infrastructure  
- Fraud prevention and DDoS protection  
- Branch network refresh and modernization

I'm not here to sell you anything today — just wanted to introduce myself and let you know NWN is a resource if you ever need one. We're local (Seattle-based with a large healthcare client nearby), we know Cisco/Juniper/Aruba/Palo Alto inside and out, and we can move fast when timing matters.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

### EMAIL #2: Virginia Mason Medical Center

**TO:** [NEED CONTACT RESEARCH - Try: CIO or Director IT Infrastructure]  
**SUBJECT:** Network infrastructure for Seattle's top hospital

Hi [First Name],

Congrats on Virginia Mason being ranked as one of Seattle's top hospitals by U.S. News for 2025-26 — that's a huge honor and a testament to the team's work.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. We've spent the last several years helping a large healthcare provider here in the Seattle area (think: RTLS, wireless across dozens of facilities, telephony infrastructure) keep their network rock-solid while meeting HIPAA requirements.

Healthcare infrastructure is under more pressure than ever — patient data security, network reliability for life-critical systems, and the constant need to do more with aging budgets. If that sounds familiar, we should talk.

I'm not pitching — just wanted to introduce myself as a resource. We specialize in:
- HIPAA-compliant network design
- Hospital wireless and RTLS (Real-Time Location Systems)
- Secure connectivity between clinics/facilities
- Cisco, Aruba, Palo Alto implementations

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

**SUBJECT:** Infrastructure for ExtraHop's operations

Hi [First Name],

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. I work with tech companies in Seattle on their network and security infrastructure.

There's a certain irony in reaching out to a network security company about infrastructure, but here's the thing: even companies that *sell* security need rock-solid networks and connectivity.
