## 📧 EMAIL #1

**TO:** david.wolf@wafd.com  
**SUBJECT:** Network infrastructure for WaFd's growing footprint

Hi David,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder and Account Executive at NWN. I work with regional banks and credit unions across the Pacific Northwest on their network infrastructure and security.

With WaFd's 200+ branches spanning 8 states, I imagine branch connectivity and security are top of mind — especially with the uptick in targeted attacks on regional financial institutions we've seen this year.

We help institutions like yours with:
- Secure multi-site connectivity (Cisco SD-WAN, DMVPN)
- PCI compliance infrastructure  
- Fraud prevention and DDoS protection  
- Branch network refresh and modernization

I'm not here to sell you anything today — just wanted to introduce myself and let you know NWN is a resource if you ever need one. We're local (Seattle-based with a large healthcare client nearby), we know Cisco/Juniper/Aruba/Palo Alto inside and out, and we can move fast when timing matters.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

## 📧 EMAIL #2

**TO:** ellen.wiegand@virginiamason.org  
**SUBJECT:** Network infrastructure for Seattle's top hospital

Hi Ellen,

Congrats on Virginia Mason being ranked as one of Seattle's top hospitals by U.S. News for 2025-26 — that's a huge honor and a testament to the team's work.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. We've spent the last several years helping a large healthcare provider here in the Seattle area (think: RTLS, wireless across dozens of facilities, telephony infrastructure) keep their network rock-solid while meeting HIPAA requirements.

Healthcare infrastructure is under more pressure than ever — patient data security, network reliability for life-critical systems, and the constant need to do more with aging budgets. If that sounds familiar, we should talk.

I'm not pitching — just wanted to introduce myself as a resource. We specialize in:
- HIPAA-compliant network design
- Hospital wireless and RTLS (Real-Time Location Systems)
- Secure connectivity between clinics/facilities
- Cisco, Aruba, Palo Alto implementations

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

## 📧 EMAIL #3

**TO:** chris.purcell@pemco.com  
**SUBJECT:** Network security for PEMCO's operations

Hi Chris,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder and Account Executive at NWN. I work with insurance companies and financial services firms in the Seattle area on their network infrastructure and cybersecurity.

With the growing pressure on insurance companies to harden their defenses against ransomware and claims data breaches, I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. We help regional insurers with:
- Multi-office secure connectivity
- Claims data security and compliance
- Disaster recovery infrastructure
- Network refresh and modernization (Cisco, Palo Alto, Aruba)

I'm not here to pitch you today — just wanted to let you know NWN is a resource if network security or infrastructure ever lands on your plate. We're Seattle-based, we move fast, and we know how to work with tight timelines and tighter budgets.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

## 📧 EMAIL #4

**TO:** jamie.adams@trupanion.com  
**SUBJECT:** Infrastructure for Trupanion's growth

Hi Jamie,

Congrats on joining Trupanion as CIO! I saw the announcement and wanted to reach out.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. I work with high-growth tech companies in Seattle on their network and security infrastructure.

As Trupanion continues to scale, I imagine infrastructure is top of mind — payment processing security, API performance, multi-cloud connectivity, and keeping everything compliant as you expand.

We help fast-moving companies like yours with:
- Secure payment infrastructure (PCI compliance)
- Multi-cloud networking (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- API gateway and load balancing
- DDoS protection and security hardening

I'm not pitching — just wanted to introduce myself as a resource. NWN specializes in Cisco, Juniper, Aruba, and Palo Alto, and we work with several Seattle-area tech companies navigating similar growth challenges.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!
