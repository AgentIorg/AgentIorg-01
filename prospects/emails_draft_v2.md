## 8. Helion Energy — Director IT & Security (OPEN ROLE!)

**Subject:** Everett neighbor + CCIE Security — quick intro

**Body:**

Hi there,

I saw Helion is hiring a Director of IT & Security — exciting time for the team as you scale toward commercial fusion.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in the Seattle area (Everett is right in my backyard). I work with NWN helping organizations build out network infrastructure and security programs.

Whether you're filling the role or building relationships with technical partners, I'd love to connect. I've helped organizations navigate everything from network architecture to security compliance — happy to be a resource as Helion grows.

If you're open to a quick intro call, I'm around. Either way, best of luck with the search.

— Chris

## 9. Crane Aerospace — Kevin O'Connell (Dir IT Infra & Cybersecurity)

**Subject:** Aerospace security expertise — quick intro from a neighbor

**Body:**

Hi Kevin,

Saw you're leading IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity at Crane Aerospace — aerospace networks are a unique challenge, especially with DFARS compliance in the mix.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations tackle network infrastructure and security architecture — everything from Cisco to Palo Alto.

Not reaching out to sell anything. Just wanted to introduce myself as a local resource. If you ever need a second opinion on vendors, architecture decisions, or compliance challenges, I'm happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket. I'm in Lynnwood regularly — happy to grab coffee if you're ever up for it.

— Chris

**Body:**

Hi Stephen,

Congrats on moving from interim to permanent CIO — well-deserved.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations with network infrastructure, security, and connectivity. I've supported other public sector and healthcare organizations in the region.

Not here to pitch anything. Just wanted to introduce myself as a local resource. When vendor questions come up, or you need a second opinion on infrastructure decisions, I'm happy to help. No strings.

Keep me in your back pocket. If timing's ever right for a quick intro call, I'm around.

Hi Andreas,

Congrats on the 2025 SeattleCIO ORBIE — well-earned recognition.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations with network infrastructure and security — everything from Cisco and Palo Alto to data center builds.

Higher ed infrastructure has unique challenges — decentralized networks, research computing, compliance requirements. If you ever need a sounding board on vendors or architecture decisions, happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket. Would love to connect if you're ever up for it.

## 12. GEICO — Rebecca Weekly (VP Infrastructure)

**Subject:** Cloud repatriation is no joke — happy to be a resource

**Body:**

Hi Rebecca,

Read about GEICO's cloud repatriation journey — moving workloads back on-prem with Kubernetes and OpenStack is ambitious (and not for the faint of heart).

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations navigate complex infrastructure projects — network architecture, data center builds, security.

Not here to pitch. Just wanted to introduce myself. If you ever want to swap notes on infrastructure architecture or need a second opinion on vendors, I'm happy to chat.

Either way, respect the bold move.

— Chris

Hi [Name],

Saw Flexport is building out the network engineering team in Bellevue — logistics at your scale needs bulletproof infrastructure.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based locally. I work with NWN helping organizations tackle network complexity, security architecture, and infrastructure scaling.

Not reaching out to sell anything. Just wanted to introduce myself as a resource. If vendor questions come up, or you need a second opinion on architecture decisions, happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket. If timing's right for a quick call, I'm around.
