## 1. DocuSign — Shanthi Iyer (CIO)

**Subject:** One Cisco person to another

**Body:**

Hi Shanthi,

Saw your path from Cisco to CIO at DocuSign — impressive journey.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations navigate network, security, and infrastructure challenges.

Not reaching out to sell anything — just wanted to connect with a fellow Cisco alum. When vendor questions come up, or you need a second opinion on an architecture decision, I'm happy to be a sounding board.

If timing's ever right for a quick call to swap notes, I'm around. Either way — nice to meet you.

## 2. Nordstrom — Security Leadership

**Subject:** Quick intro — Cisco CCIE + security transformation

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Noticed Nordstrom is investing in the security organization — congrats on the momentum.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping companies tackle security architecture, network infrastructure, and everything in between — Cisco, Palo Alto, you name it.

Not here to pitch. Just introducing myself as a local resource. When you're evaluating vendors, architectures, or just want a second opinion from someone who's been in the weeds — happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket. If the timing's ever right for a 15-minute call, I'm around.

— Chris

## 3. Providence Health — Ivette de Rubens (Interim CIO)

**Subject:** Healthcare IT resource — CCIE Security in your backyard

**Body:**

Hi Ivette,

I know Providence is navigating a leadership transition — never an easy time for IT teams.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based in Seattle. I work with NWN supporting healthcare organizations with network infrastructure, security, and connectivity. I currently support MultiCare with their RTLS, wireless, and telephony — so I know the healthcare IT world well.

Not reaching out to sell anything today. Just wanted to introduce myself as a local resource. If questions come up during the transition, or you need a second opinion on anything infrastructure-related, I'm happy to help.

Either way, wishing you smooth sailing.

— Chris

## 4. Gates Foundation — Kim Johnston

**Subject:** Quick intro — Seattle-based CCIE resource

**Body:**

Hi Kim,

I know foundation-scale infrastructure requires partners you can trust over the long haul.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based here in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations with network, security, and infrastructure — everything from Cisco and Palo Alto to data center builds.

Not here to pitch. Just wanted to introduce myself. When vendor questions come up, or you're looking for a second opinion on an architecture decision, I'm happy to be a sounding board. No strings.

Keep me in your back pocket. If you ever want to grab 15 minutes to connect, I'm around.

## 5. Blue Origin — IT/Security Leadership

**Subject:** Aerospace networks leave no room for error

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I saw Blue Origin is investing heavily in the security and infrastructure teams — makes sense given the stakes.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based in Seattle (Kent's practically my backyard). I work with NWN helping organizations with network infrastructure, security architecture, and mission-critical systems.

Aerospace-grade networks don't leave room for error. If you ever need a sounding board on vendors, architectures, or security decisions — happy to be a resource.

Keep me in your back pocket. If timing's right for a quick intro call, I'm around.

Hi [Name],

Starlink's network challenges are unlike anything else in the industry — exciting stuff.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based in Seattle. I work with NWN helping organizations tackle complex network infrastructure and security challenges.

Not here to pitch — just introducing myself as a local resource. If you ever need a second opinion on vendors, architecture decisions, or just want to talk shop, I'm happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket. I'm in Redmond regularly — happy to grab coffee if you're ever up for it.

## 7. Palantir — Network Infrastructure

Hi [Name],

Saw Palantir is building out the network infrastructure team in Seattle — exciting growth.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security based locally. I work with NWN helping organizations navigate network complexity, security architecture, and infrastructure scaling.

Not reaching out to sell anything. Just wanted to introduce myself as a resource. When vendor questions come up, or you need a second opinion on an architecture decision, I'm happy to help.
