## EMAIL 1: OpenAI Bellevue — Infrastructure Buildout 🔥🔥🔥
**To:** [Need to find - facilities/IT director]
**Subject:** 583K sq ft buildout — data center cabling & infrastructure

Hi [Name],

Saw OpenAI just leased the massive Bellevue space — congrats on the expansion!

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security with NWN. We specialize in data center buildouts for AI/compute workloads — and I have a cabling crew ready to move on large-scale projects like this.

AI infrastructure has unique demands: high-density power, low-latency networking, redundancy at every layer. We've done similar work with a large healthcare provider in the region supporting RTLS and high-bandwidth medical systems.

I know you're in planning mode right now. If you need a resource for:
- Data center cabling (Cat6A, fiber, copper)
- Network architecture (Cisco, Juniper, Aruba)
- Security infrastructure (Palo Alto, zero-trust design)

I'm happy to be a sounding board or provide a crew when you're ready to execute.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

— Chris

**P.S.** - Happy to do a walkthrough and provide a quick assessment. No obligation.

## EMAIL 2: F5 Inc — Post-Breach Infrastructure Rebuild
**To:** [Need to find - CISO/CTO]
**Subject:** Post-breach infrastructure — CCIE Security resource

Hi [Name],

I know the nation-state breach was a tough situation. Security companies getting breached is every CISO's nightmare.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security with NWN. I work with organizations rebuilding infrastructure after security incidents — helping them come back stronger.

Post-breach rebuilds are an opportunity to implement zero-trust architecture, micro-segmentation, and modern security controls. And when you're F5, credibility restoration matters.

If you need a sounding board on vendors, architecture decisions, or just want to talk through the rebuild strategy with someone who's been there, I'm happy to help.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

— Chris

## EMAIL 3: Port of Seattle — Ransomware Recovery & Security Upgrade
**To:** [Need to find - IT Director/CISO]
**Subject:** Post-ransomware infrastructure — CCIE Security resource

Hi [Name],

The ransomware attack was rough — 90K people affected is a significant incident, especially for critical infrastructure.

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security with NWN. I work with organizations rebuilding security infrastructure after incidents like this.

Ports have unique challenges: OT/IT convergence, legacy systems, public scrutiny, compliance requirements. But post-incident is when you get the budget and executive support to do it RIGHT.

If you need a resource for:
- Network segmentation (isolating OT from IT)
- Security architecture (Palo Alto, Cisco, zero-trust)
- Compliance frameworks (NIST, CIS)

I'm happy to be a sounding board. No sales pitch — just advice from someone who's helped organizations come back stronger.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!

— Chris

## 💡 WHY THESE ARE DIFFERENT

**Standard cold email:** "I'm a CCIE, keep me in your back pocket"
**Hot trigger email:** "I saw [specific event], here's how I can help with [exact problem]"

Timing + relevance = way higher response rates.

Strike while the iron is HOT. 🔥
