It's been a while! I hope things are going well at Costco.

## 💡 NOTES

**Tone differences from cold emails:**
- Start with "It's been a while" or "Hope things are going well"
- Reference past work together (even vaguely)
- "Reconnect" instead of "introduce myself"
- "Catch up" instead of "keep me in your back pocket"
- More casual, less formal
- Coffee/call invitation is warmer

**These should get higher response rates than cold outreach!**
