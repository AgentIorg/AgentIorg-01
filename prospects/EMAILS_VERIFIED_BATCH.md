## 📧 EMAIL #1 - DOCUSIGN CIO ⭐⭐⭐

**TO:** shanthi.iyer@docusign.com  
**VERIFIED:** 100% score  
**SUBJECT:** Network infrastructure for DocuSign

Hi Shanthi,

I'm Chris Iorg, a Cisco CCIE Security holder at NWN. I work with Seattle-area tech companies on their network infrastructure and security.

DocuSign handles millions of sensitive documents daily — contracts, agreements, legal filings. That kind of data makes you a high-value target, and I imagine infrastructure security and reliability are always top of mind.

We help companies like yours with:
- Multi-cloud networking (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Zero trust architecture implementation
- API security and DDoS protection
- SOC 2 compliance infrastructure

I'm not pitching today — just wanted to introduce myself as a local resource. We're Seattle-based and work with several tech companies navigating similar security challenges.

Keep me in your back pocket and feel free to use me as a resource in the future!
