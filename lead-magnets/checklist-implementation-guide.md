🚨 3 network security mistakes I see in every audit:

1. Overly permissive firewall rules
   → "permit ip any any" is never acceptable
   → Default deny + explicit allow is the only way

2. Shared administrative passwords
   → No TACACS+/RADIUS = security incident waiting to happen
   → MFA should be mandatory, not optional

3. No network segmentation
   → Flat networks = one compromise becomes total breach
   → VLANs + ACLs cost nothing but save everything

Want the complete list of 100+ security controls?

I've put together a comprehensive checklist covering everything from perimeter security to incident response.
