I get this question weekly.

Here's my 60-day audit prep framework:

• Network topology diagrams
• Security policy documentation
• Control inventory vs. requirements

Days 16-35: Critical Remediation
• MFA everywhere
• Centralized logging + SIEM
• Network segmentation
• Patch critical vulnerabilities

Days 36-50: Evidence Collection
• Log retention proof
• Access control logs
• Change management records
• Incident response tests

Days 51-60: Pre-Audit Review
• Self-assessment against controls
• Mock audit with internal/external reviewer
• Remediate final gaps

The secret? Systematic execution.
