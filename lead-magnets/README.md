## ⚠️ Important: Customization Required

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### This works if:
✅ PDF provides genuine, actionable value  
✅ Landing page is clear and conversion-optimized  
✅ Email sequence nurtures without being pushy  
✅ Chris/NWN responds quickly to consultation requests  
✅ Marketing is consistent (not one-and-done)  
✅ Content feels helpful, not salesy

### This fails if:
❌ PDF is generic/low-value (won't get shared)  
❌ Email sequence is too aggressive (high unsubscribes)  
❌ No follow-up on leads (wasted effort)  
❌ Inconsistent marketing (one post then silence)  
❌ Landing page has technical issues (broken links, no delivery)
