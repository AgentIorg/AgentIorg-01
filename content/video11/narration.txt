VPNs are dying. Not because they're insecure — but because they're solving yesterday's problem. Here's why enterprises are abandoning VPNs for zero trust network access.

The VPN model assumes a perimeter. Get through the VPN, and you're "inside" — trusted. But when your apps are in the cloud, your users are at home, and your contractors are everywhere, where exactly is "inside"?

Problem one: VPNs are all or nothing. Connect to the VPN, get access to the entire network. That's way too much trust for a single authentication event. One compromised laptop equals one compromised network.

Problem two: Performance. Backhauling traffic through a VPN concentrator when users are accessing cloud apps creates latency. Why route Seattle to Azure through your Texas data center?

Problem three: Scalability. VPN concentrators have capacity limits. Remember the early pandemic when everyone's VPN crashed? That's not a bug — it's an architecture problem.

Zero trust network access flips the model. Instead of network access, you get application access. Each connection is verified, authorized, and encrypted independently. Least privilege by design.

ZTNA solutions like Zscaler, Cloudflare Access, or Palo Alto Prisma verify identity, device posture, and context before granting access to specific applications — not entire networks.

The transition isn't overnight. Most companies run hybrid for years. But the direction is clear: identity-based access is replacing network-based access.
