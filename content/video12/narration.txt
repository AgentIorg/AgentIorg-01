DNS is the most overlooked attack vector in enterprise security. Every device on your network makes DNS queries. And most companies have zero visibility into what those queries are.

Here's why DNS matters: Malware needs to phone home. Phishing sites need domain resolution. Data exfiltration often tunnels through DNS. If you're not monitoring DNS, you're flying blind.

Threat one: DNS tunneling. Attackers encode data in DNS queries and responses. Your firewall sees normal DNS traffic while gigabytes of data walk out the door. It's slow but nearly invisible.

Threat two: Domain generation algorithms. Modern malware doesn't hardcode command and control servers. It generates random-looking domains daily. By the time you block one, there are a hundred more.

Threat three: Lookalike domains. Attacker registers microsoftdotcom with a zero, or amazom dot com. Your users type it, DNS resolves it, and they're on a phishing site. Traditional security doesn't catch this.

Solution one: DNS filtering. Services like Cisco Umbrella, Cloudflare Gateway, or Palo Alto DNS Security block known-bad domains before the connection happens. It's your first line of defense.

Solution two: DNS logging and analysis. Log every DNS query. Look for anomalies: high query volumes, queries to newly registered domains, suspicious TXT records. This is where you catch the tunneling.

Solution three: Encrypted DNS with control. DNS over HTTPS is great for privacy, but terrible for security if you can't inspect it. Deploy enterprise DoH with your own resolvers.

DNS security isn't optional anymore. If you're not watching DNS, attackers know it. Link in description for a DNS security assessment.
