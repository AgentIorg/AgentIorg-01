# Video 9: Multi-Cloud Security - The Gaps No One Talks About

## Script

Your cloud is probably less secure than you think. When companies go multi-cloud — AWS, Azure, GCP — security gaps multiply. Here's what nobody warns you about.

Gap number one: Identity sprawl. Each cloud has its own IAM system. AWS roles, Azure AD, GCP service accounts. Without centralized identity management, you're managing hundreds of separate access controls. That's where mistakes happen.

Gap number two: Inconsistent security policies. Your AWS security groups don't talk to Azure NSGs. You end up with different rules in each cloud, and no single view of your actual security posture. Drift is inevitable.

Gap number three: Blind spots between clouds. Traffic flowing between AWS and Azure? Who's inspecting that? Most companies have great visibility within each cloud but zero visibility on cross-cloud traffic.

Gap number four: Compliance complexity. SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI — proving compliance across three different cloud environments with three different logging systems is a nightmare. Auditors love it.

Gap number five: Shared responsibility confusion. Each cloud provider has different boundaries for what they secure versus what you secure. Misunderstanding those boundaries leads to exposed S3 buckets and public databases.

The fix? Cloud-agnostic security tools, centralized identity, and treating multi-cloud like the complex environment it is — not three separate problems.
