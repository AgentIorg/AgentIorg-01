Security budgets are always too small. Here's how to make the case for more — and how to prioritize when you don't get it.

The reality: Boards don't speak risk matrices. They speak money. "We need better endpoint protection" means nothing. "A breach will cost us 4 million dollars and this tool reduces that risk by 60 percent" — that's a conversation.

Step one: Quantify your current risk. What data do you have? What's it worth? What would a breach cost in downtime, legal fees, reputation damage? Use industry benchmarks if you don't have your own numbers.

Step two: Map spending to risk reduction. Every security dollar should reduce specific risks. If you can't explain what risk a tool reduces, question whether you need it.

Step three: Compare to industry benchmarks. Most companies spend 3 to 6 percent of IT budget on security. If you're below that, you have a benchmark argument. If you're above, you need to show results.

Step four: Present total cost of ownership. That "cheap" solution with high operational overhead isn't actually cheap. Factor in training, maintenance, integration, staff time.

When budget is tight, prioritize ruthlessly. Basic hygiene first: patching, MFA, backups, endpoint protection. Fancy threat intelligence means nothing if you haven't covered the basics.

Quick wins matter. Show value fast. One prevented incident pays for a lot of tools. Document your wins and share them with leadership.

Security is a business function. Speak the language of the business. Dollars, risk, compliance, reputation. That's how you get budget.
