Antivirus is dead. Traditional signature-based detection can't keep up with modern threats. Here's what actually works for endpoint security in 2026.

The old model: Signature matching. Scan files, compare to known malware. Problem? New malware variants appear every second. By the time you have a signature, the attack is over.

EDR — Endpoint Detection and Response — changed the game. Instead of just blocking known bad files, EDR watches behavior. Process spawning cmd dot exe? PowerShell downloading from the internet? That's suspicious regardless of file signatures.

Key capability one: Behavioral analysis. What's the process doing? Normal applications don't inject code into other processes. Normal users don't run encoded PowerShell at midnight.

Key capability two: Threat intelligence integration. Real-time feeds of indicators of compromise. Hash matches, malicious IPs, known attacker infrastructure. Your endpoint should know what threat actors are using today.

Key capability three: Automated response. When EDR detects compromise, it can isolate the endpoint immediately. No waiting for human analysis. Cut off the attack while you investigate.

Key capability four: Forensic data. Every process, every network connection, every file modification — logged and searchable. When something happens, you can reconstruct exactly what occurred.

The market leaders: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Carbon Black. They're not antivirus — they're security platforms.

If you're still relying on traditional AV, you're fighting yesterday's war. Endpoints are where attacks start. Protect them accordingly.
