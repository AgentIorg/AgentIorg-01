Password policies haven't kept up with the threats. If you're still forcing 90-day password changes and complex character requirements, you're making security worse, not better.

Here's what NIST now recommends — and why most companies ignore it.

Old rule: Change passwords every 90 days. New reality: Forced rotation leads to "Password1, Password2, Password3." Users pick predictable patterns. It's human nature.

Old rule: Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols. New reality: "P@ssw0rd!" meets the requirements and gets cracked in seconds. Complexity requirements create the illusion of security.

Better approach: Length over complexity. A 16-character passphrase is stronger than an 8-character complex password. "correct horse battery staple" beats "Tr0ub4dor!" every time.

Better approach: Check against breach databases. Services like "Have I Been Pwned" let you verify passwords haven't appeared in known breaches. Reject compromised passwords at creation.

Better approach: MFA everywhere. Passwords alone aren't enough. Hardware keys, authenticator apps, even SMS is better than nothing. Prioritize phishing-resistant methods like FIDO2.

Better approach: Password managers. Users can't remember strong unique passwords for 100 accounts. Give them enterprise password managers. Make it easier to do the right thing.

The goal isn't perfect passwords — it's reducing the attack surface. Length, uniqueness, MFA, and breach checking beat complexity theater.
