# YouTube Script #6: "Enterprise WiFi Security: 5 Mistakes That Get Companies Hacked"

## HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"Your WiFi network is probably your biggest security vulnerability. I'm Chris Iorg, a CCIE Security engineer, and I've seen companies get breached through WiFi more times than I can count. Here are the 5 mistakes I see constantly."

## MISTAKE 1: SAME NETWORK FOR EVERYTHING (0:15-0:45)
"Guest WiFi, corporate devices, IoT sensors, security cameras - all on the same network. One compromised camera and an attacker has a path to your payroll system. You need separate SSIDs with proper segmentation. Guest should NEVER touch corporate."

## MISTAKE 2: WPA2 IN 2026 (0:45-1:10)
"If you're still on WPA2-Personal, you're running security from 2004. WPA3 has been available for years. The crack time difference is measured in centuries, not hours. Upgrade."

## MISTAKE 3: WEAK PASSWORD POLICIES (1:10-1:35)
"Your WiFi password is probably written on a whiteboard somewhere. And it hasn't changed since 2019. Use 802.1X with certificate-based authentication. Every device gets its own credentials. Someone leaves? Revoke their cert."

## MISTAKE 4: NO MONITORING (1:35-2:00)
"Do you know when someone connects to your WiFi? Do you know what devices are on your network right now? Most companies have no wireless intrusion detection. Rogue access points appear and stay for months."

## MISTAKE 5: DEFAULT CONFIGURATIONS (2:00-2:25)
"Admin interface on default port. Default SNMP strings. No rate limiting. SSID broadcasting your company name to every wardriver in the parking lot. These defaults make you an easy target."

## THE FIX (2:25-2:50)
"Enterprise-grade access points. WPA3. 802.1X authentication. Network segmentation. Wireless IDS. It sounds expensive, but it's cheaper than a breach. A proper wireless design can be done for under $50K at most organizations."
