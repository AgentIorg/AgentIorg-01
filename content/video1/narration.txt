I'm a Cisco CCIE Security engineer, and I've seen companies lose MILLIONS because of simple network security mistakes. Today I'm breaking down the 5 most expensive mistakes I see and how to avoid them.

Mistake number one: Flat Networks. I walked into a large healthcare provider last year. 5,000 employees, hundreds of medical devices, and their network? Completely flat. Everything on one network. One breach means total compromise. The fix? Micro-segmentation and zero-trust architecture.

Mistake number two: Set It and Forget It Security. Companies buy expensive firewalls then never update them. I've seen Fortune 500 companies running 5-year-old firmware. The fix? Quarterly security audits at minimum.

Mistake number three: Ignoring Insider Threats. 60% of breaches involve insiders. Employees, contractors, vendors. The fix? Role-based access control and log everything.

Mistake number four: Weak Wireless. Companies spend half a million on wired infrastructure then deploy consumer-grade access points. The fix? Enterprise-grade APs, separate SSIDs for guest and corporate, and WPA3.

Mistake number five: No Disaster Recovery Plan. If your data center flooded tomorrow, how long until you're back online? Most companies don't know. The fix? Cloud backup, failover sites, and DR drills twice a year.

These mistakes are common and expensive. But they're all fixable. If you want a free 15-minute network assessment, check the link in the description. No sales pitch, just honest advice from a CCIE Security engineer.
