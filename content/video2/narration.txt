Is CCIE still worth it in 2026? I'm a CCIE Security engineer, and I'm going to give you the honest answer. Spoiler: it's not what most people think.

First, some context. I earned my CCIE Security a few years ago. Thousands of hours of study. Lab rentals. Practice exams. Failures. The whole journey cost around 15 thousand dollars and six months of my life.

So is it worth it? Yes. But not for the reasons you might expect.

Reason number one: It's not about the paper. CCIE doesn't guarantee you a six-figure job. What it does is signal to employers that you can solve complex problems, you have discipline, and you can learn hard things.

I've interviewed candidates with CCIE who couldn't troubleshoot a basic routing issue. And I've hired non-CCIEs who were rockstars. The paper doesn't make you good. The process of earning it does.

Reason number two: Networking isn't dead. Everyone says cloud killed traditional networking. Wrong. The cloud RUNS on networks. Every AWS region, every Azure datacenter needs network engineers. The tools changed, but the fundamentals matter more than ever.

Reason number three: CCIE holders are rare. Less than 70,000 active CCIEs worldwide. That's a tiny fraction of IT professionals. In a sea of cloud certifications, CCIE still stands out.

Reason number four: It opens doors you didn't know existed. Consulting gigs. Speaking opportunities. Higher salary negotiations. The credential gives you credibility that compounds over time.

But here's the honest truth: If you're just collecting certifications, don't bother. CCIE is brutal. You need a real reason to push through. But if you want to master networking at a deep level, there's no substitute.

My recommendation? If you're in enterprise networking and want to advance, CCIE is worth considering. But get real experience first. The cert validates expertise. It doesn't create it.
