# YouTube Script #5: "Your Network Security Audit is Outdated (Here's What to Check in 2026)"

## HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"When was your last network security audit? If it was more than 6 months ago, it's already outdated. I'm Chris Iorg, a CCIE Security engineer, and I'm going to show you the 7 things most audits miss in 2026."

## THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:45)
"Most network audits are stuck in 2019. They check firewalls, antivirus, and password policies. That's table stakes. The threat landscape has evolved, and your audit needs to evolve too."

## WHAT TO CHECK (0:45-3:00)

### 1. Cloud Configuration (0:45-1:00)
"Are your AWS/Azure security groups properly locked down? I've seen S3 buckets wide open at Fortune 500 companies. Cloud misconfigurations are now the #1 cause of breaches."

### 2. API Security (1:00-1:15)
"How many APIs does your organization expose? Most companies don't know. APIs are the new attack surface."

### 3. Identity and Access Management (1:15-1:30)
"Who has admin access? When did you last review it? I guarantee you have former employees and contractors still in your Active Directory."

### 4. Lateral Movement Paths (1:30-1:50)
"If an attacker gets on one workstation, can they reach your domain controller? Can they reach your database servers? Most networks allow unrestricted lateral movement."

### 5. Supply Chain Security (1:50-2:10)
"What vendors have access to your network? VPN credentials for your HVAC company led to the Target breach. Who has keys to your kingdom?"

### 6. Backup and Recovery Testing (2:10-2:30)
"When did you last TEST a restore? Not check that backups ran - actually restore from backup? 42% of backup restores fail when you actually need them."

### 7. Incident Response Plan (2:30-2:50)
"Do you have a plan? Has your team practiced it? Can you reach your incident response team at 2 AM on a Saturday?"
