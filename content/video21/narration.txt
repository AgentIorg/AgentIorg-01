You can't protect what you can't see. Network monitoring is the foundation of security — and most companies do it badly. Here's what actually matters.

Level one: Flow data. NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX — metadata about every connection. Source, destination, ports, bytes transferred. You can't inspect every packet, but you can see every conversation.

Level two: Packet capture. When you need to dig deeper, full packet capture tells the whole story. Strategic tap points at network boundaries, not everywhere. Storage is expensive — capture smart.

Level three: Application visibility. Port 443 doesn't mean "safe web traffic." You need to see what applications are actually running. Next-gen firewalls and NDR solutions decode protocols and identify applications.

Level four: Encrypted traffic analysis. Most traffic is encrypted now. You can't always decrypt it, but you can analyze patterns. JA3 fingerprints, certificate metadata, connection behavior — encrypted doesn't mean invisible.

Level five: Baseline and anomaly detection. What's normal for your network? That's the baseline. Deviations are interesting. A server suddenly talking to a new country at 3 AM — that's worth investigating.

The tools: Zeek for deep packet analysis. Darktrace, Vectra, or ExtraHop for AI-driven NDR. Elastic or Splunk for flow analysis. Layer them based on risk.

Visibility isn't optional. Attackers live on your network for months before detection. The only way to find them faster is to watch everything.
