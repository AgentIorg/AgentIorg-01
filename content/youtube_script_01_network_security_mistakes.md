## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

"I'm a Cisco CCIE Security engineer, and I've seen companies lose MILLIONS because of simple network security mistakes that could've been prevented for under $50,000. Today I'm breaking down the 5 most expensive mistakes I see—and how to avoid them. If you're responsible for IT infrastructure, this could save your job... or your company."

## MISTAKE #1: Treating the Network Like It's 2015 (0:30-2:00)

**The Problem:**
"I walked into a large healthcare provider in the Pacific Northwest last year. 5,000+ employees. Hundreds of medical devices. And their network segmentation? FLAT. Everything on one giant network."

**Why It's Expensive:**
- One breach = entire network compromised
- Compliance violations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Ransomware spreads like wildfire
- Real cost: $3-5 million in downtime + fines

**The Fix:**
"Micro-segmentation. VLANs. Zero-trust architecture. It's not sexy, but it works. And it's WAY cheaper than a breach."

---

## MISTAKE #2: "Set It and Forget It" Security (2:00-3:30)

**The Problem:**
"Companies buy Palo Alto firewalls, Cisco switches, the best gear money can buy... then never update the configs. I've seen Fortune 500 companies running firmware from 2019. That's like buying a Tesla and never charging it."

**Why It's Expensive:**
- Known vulnerabilities = easy targets
- Zero-day exploits spread fast
- Insurance won't cover negligence
- Real cost: Breach cleanup + reputation damage

**The Fix:**
"Managed security services. Or at minimum, quarterly security audits. You don't need a full-time team—you need someone checking regularly."

---

## MISTAKE #3: Ignoring Insider Threats (3:30-5:00)

**The Problem:**
"Everyone focuses on hackers in hoodies. But 60% of breaches involve insiders—employees, contractors, vendors. I've seen disgruntled IT admins delete entire databases on their way out."

**Why It's Expensive:**
- Hard to detect until it's too late
- Legal liability (wrongful termination lawsuits)
- Data loss can't always be recovered
- Real cost: Millions in lost data + lawsuits

**The Fix:**
"Role-based access control. Logging EVERYTHING. Offboarding checklists. The best security assumes people will make mistakes—or worse."

---

## MISTAKE #4: Treating Wireless Like an Afterthought (5:00-6:30)

**The Problem:**
"Wireless is often the weakest link. I've seen companies spend $500K on wired infrastructure, then deploy $200 consumer-grade access points. Or worse—guest WiFi on the same network as production systems."

**Why It's Expensive:**
- Easy entry point for attackers
- Performance issues = lost productivity
- IoT devices (cameras, sensors) create vulnerabilities
- Real cost: Downtime + breach risk

**The Fix:**
"Enterprise-grade access points. Separate SSIDs for guest, IoT, and corporate. WPA3. Coverage planning. This isn't optional anymore—it's infrastructure."

---

## MISTAKE #5: No Disaster Recovery Plan (6:30-8:00)

**The Problem:**
"I ask companies: 'If your data center flooded tomorrow, how long until you're back online?' Most don't have an answer. That's terrifying."

**Why It's Expensive:**
- Downtime = lost revenue (thousands per minute)
- Scrambling during a crisis = bad decisions
- No leverage with vendors during emergency
- Real cost: Business-ending for some companies

**The Fix:**
"Cloud backup. Failover sites. DR drills twice a year. It sounds expensive, but it's insurance—you hope you never need it, but when you do, it's priceless."

---

## WRAP-UP (8:00-9:00)

"Look, I'm not trying to scare you. But I've been doing this long enough to know: these mistakes are COMMON. And they're expensive. The good news? They're all fixable."
