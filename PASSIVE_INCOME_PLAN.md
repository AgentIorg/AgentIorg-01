## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

✅ **You need to:**

2. Approve course outlines by Week 2
3. Record 2-3 video modules in Week 3
4. Spend 2-3 hours/month ongoing

❌ **What will kill this:**
1. Delays in account setup (delays everything 2+ weeks)
2. Not approving outlines on schedule
3. Expecting $10K/month in Month 2 (takes 6-12 months)
4. Not recording video modules (gaps in courses = lower sales)

✅ **What will make this explode:**
1. You record one course live (on YouTube) → massively increases engagement
2. You do 1-2 guest appearances on networking podcasts
3. You write 1-2 LinkedIn articles linking to courses
4. You partner with 2-3 influencers in the security space
